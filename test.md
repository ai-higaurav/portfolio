  }
}
```

#### Additional Options
- **emitDecoratorMetadata**: Emit design-type metadata for decorated declarations in source files.

## Additional Information

### Expanding the ESLint Configuration
If you are developing a production application, it is recommended to update the ESLint configuration to enable type-aware lint rules. Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property as follows:

```js
export default {
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```
